# Cash Register App

This Cash Register app calculates the change to be returned to the customer based on the price of the item, the amount of cash provided by the customer, and the amount of cash available in the cash drawer. The app also displays different messages to the user in various scenarios such as insufficient funds, exact payment, and whether the cash drawer should remain open or be closed.
